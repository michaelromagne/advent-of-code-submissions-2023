Temporian is an open-source Python library designed for the preprocessing and feature engineering of temporal data in machine learning applications. It simplifies handling various temporal data types, including multivariate time-series, event logs, and non-synchronized event streams. Temporian stands out for its efficiency, with core computations optimized in C++ and capable of processing temporal data over 1,000 times faster than standard data processing libraries. It seamlessly integrates into existing ML ecosystems, supporting libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and ensures safe data handling by preventing future data leakage in feature computationâ€‹.
