TruLens provides a set of tools for developing and monitoring neural nets, including large language models. This includes both tools for evaluation of LLMs and LLM-based applications with TruLens-Eval and deep learning explainability with TruLens-Explain. TruLens-Eval and TruLens-Explain are housed in separate packages and can be used independently.

**My opinion:** I was curious to test this library as I am a user of [Giskard AI](https://github.com/Giskard-AI/giskard) to test models, and they took the LLM wave pretty well. Unfortunately, Trulens tutorials are not updated and I do not have time to dig into this...
