# Apache Flink

Apache Flink is a robust stream processing framework. Flink is known for its ability to handle complex, stateful computations over large-scale data streams with high throughput and low latency. It integrates well with Kafka for data ingestion, real-time data processing and analytics using SQL-like expressions.

**My opinion:**

Again, it's interesting to see different types of libraries. Like Proton, I will not use it in the next months though.
