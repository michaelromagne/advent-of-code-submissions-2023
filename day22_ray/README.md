Ray is an open-source, unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications, featuring a core distributed runtime and a suite of AI libraries. These libraries facilitate tasks such as scalable datasets management for ML, distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, reinforcement learning, and programmable serving. Ray's core abstractions include stateless function execution, stateful worker processes, and immutable values accessible across clusters. Designed for general-purpose use, Ray supports various environments, including any machine, cluster, cloud provider, and Kubernetes, backed by a growing ecosystem of community integrations.
