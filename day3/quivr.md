# Quivr

![quivr_logo](quivr.png)

Quivr is your second brain. Or actually, your multiple second brains.

Quivr brings the power of generative AI on your [local machine in less than 10 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu-sn&q=RAG+quivr). Based on RAG, you can create multiple "Brains" with specific domain knowledge that you are able to query at will.

Quivr needs an openAI api key to work, or can also do the job with [Ollama]() running locally, which is a strong plus if you want to keep your data safe (and if your machine can handle it).

Overall, Quivr is a neat library and RAG is very powerful so I may create a few brains in the upcoming days, it may be fun and satisfying.
